# Chess Hawk - Netlify Deployment Guide

## ✅ Ready for Netlify!

Your Chess Hawk application is now configured for seamless Netlify deployment.

## 🚀 Netlify Configuration

### Build Settings
- **Build command**: `npm run build:production`
- **Publish directory**: `dist`
- **Node.js version**: 18

### What happens during build:
1. **npm install** - Installs dependencies
2. **npm run build:production** - Runs our custom build script:
   - Builds TypeScript bundle → `dist/chess-hawk.min.js`
   - Copies libraries → `dist/lib/`
   - Copies source files → `dist/src/`
   - Creates `dist/index.html` (renamed from index-production.html)

## 📁 Production Structure

After build, Netlify will serve from `dist/`:

```
dist/
├── index.html              # ← Netlify serves this automatically
├── chess-hawk.min.js       # ← Your application bundle (34KB)
├── lib/                    # ← All JavaScript libraries
│   ├── jquery.min.js
│   ├── chess.min.js
│   ├── chessboard.min.js
│   └── chessboard.min.css
└── src/                    # ← CSS, data, images
    ├── css/
    ├── data/
    └── img/
```

## 🎯 Setup Options

### Option 1: Web UI (Recommended)
1. Connect your Git repository to Netlify
2. Set build settings:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build:production`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
3. Deploy!

### Option 2: netlify.toml (Automatic)
The `netlify.toml` file is already configured in your repository.
Just connect your repo and Netlify will use these settings automatically.

## 🔧 Build Commands Available

```bash
# Full production build (what Netlify runs)
npm run build:production

# Individual steps (for debugging)
npm run build:prod-bundle    # Build JS bundle only
npm run build:copy-libs      # Copy libraries and files only

# Local testing
npm run preview:production   # Test production build locally
```

## ✨ Key Benefits

- **✅ No node_modules in production** - Clean deployment
- **✅ Fast loading** - Optimized 34KB bundle + cached libraries
- **✅ Automatic serving** - `index.html` loads automatically
- **✅ Complete functionality** - All Chess Hawk features work
- **✅ Mobile ready** - Touch-friendly responsive design
- **✅ SEO optimized** - Proper meta tags and structure

## 🧪 Test Before Deploy

```bash
# Test production build locally
npm run build:production
cd dist
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Visit http://localhost:8080
```

Should show:
- ✅ Chessboard renders correctly
- ✅ "New Problem" button works
- ✅ Pieces can be moved
- ✅ All UI elements functional
- ✅ Console shows "Production Mode"

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Build fails on Netlify
- Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
- Ensure all dependencies in package.json
- Review build logs for specific errors

### App doesn't load
- Check browser console for 404 errors
- Verify library files are present in `dist/lib/`
- Ensure `dist/index.html` was created

### JavaScript errors
- Libraries load in correct order: jQuery → Chess.js → Chessboard.js → App
- Check that `chess-hawk.min.js` was built successfully

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Repository connected to Netlify
- [ ] Build command: `npm run build:production`
- [ ] Publish directory: `dist`
- [ ] Test build locally first
- [ ] Commit all changes to Git
- [ ] Trigger deployment
- [ ] Verify live site works

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your Chess Hawk application will automatically:
1. **Build** with Netlify's build system
2. **Deploy** to a global CDN
3. **Serve** the production-optimized version
4. **Work** exactly like your development version

Just connect your repository and deploy! 🚀
