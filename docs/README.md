## üéØ Quick Navigation

### For Developers
- Start with [CLAUDE.md](./development/CLAUDE.md) for development setup
- Review [DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md](./development/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md) for project direction
- Check [PUZZLE_SYSTEM_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md](./development/PUZZLE_SYSTEM_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md) for current focus

### For DevOps/Deployment
- Read [github-actions.md](./deployment/github-actions.md) for CI/CD setup
- Follow [docker.md](./deployment/docker.md) for containerization
- Use [NETLIFY-DEPLOYMENT.md](./deployment/NETLIFY-DEPLOYMENT.md) for web deployment

### For Testing
- See [TESTING.md](./guides/TESTING.md) for comprehensive testing guide
- Use [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./guides/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for issue resolution

## üîß Current Focus Areas

1. **Puzzle Quality Improvement** - Replacing generated puzzles with high-quality Lichess imports
2. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Comprehensive automated testing and deployment
3. **Container Deployment** - Docker-based development and production environments
4. **Documentation Organization** - Streamlined, purpose-driven documentation

## üìù Documentation Guidelines

### What to Keep
- **Development setup and commands** - Essential for onboarding
- **Deployment procedures** - Critical for operations
- **Architecture decisions** - Important for maintenance
- **Current project plans** - Active development guidance
- **Testing strategies** - Quality assurance

### What We Removed
- Redundant completion reports
- Outdated implementation details
- Duplicate information
- Historical development logs (unless architecturally significant)

## üöÄ Getting Started
